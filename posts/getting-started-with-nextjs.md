title: 'Getting Started With NextJS'

I've been programming for a decade and never had my own blog. After running into a reference for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) this past week, and going through their tutorial, I figured it was a great time to get my own blog set up. Especially since I bought a custom domain earlier this year!

I made some changes as I was going through their tutorial. First, I decided to get started with the TypeScript example instead of the default JavaScript. JavaScript's loose typing can be fun, but I really prefer the guiderails of a stronger type system.

The other major change is that I'm using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styling. It's not quite as pretty as their example, but it works, and I get to learn a new tool.

My current plan is to write a new blog post every week, with what I learned throughout the week.

My immediate goal is for this week is to get Tailwind to play nicely with the Markdown files I'm using to write each blog post.
